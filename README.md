# CryptoCurrencyConsulting
The Repository for our client's websites. Here we'll hold the website files as well as the design sketches.
The main branch will only hold changes that I have been approved and finalized for the final product. Any and all changes*, additions and uploads must first be uploaded into a separate branch and then submitted for review.
Once the review has been processed, and any changes if neccesary made, it will be commited and merged into the main branch.

Look over the projects page to see what the gameplan is and what we need to do. If you begin to work on one of the projects there, make sure to notify the group and move the item to the In Progress column.

* With the exception of sketches and basic designs
